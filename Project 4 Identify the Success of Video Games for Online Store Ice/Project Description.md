# Project Description:

This project is to analyse the dataset from the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow the store to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.
